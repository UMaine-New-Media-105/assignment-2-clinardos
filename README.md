Assignnment 2-q1 link: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/OTcik2PZn; This is the p5.js link for the first question of Assignment 2. Within this question I copied my code from the previous assignment in which I had created the letter "C" In a pink color with a dark pink background out of squares. For this question, I essentially redid my code or vamped up to create a function in which would create a row within the sketch. I then wrote code that would display multiple of the rows to form a grid. Next, I created another function to allow the "C" to show on top of the row function.

Assignment 2-q2 link: https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/oLZ_deAlb For this assignment, the goal was to make our own shapes. I decided that I would try to sketch out the outline of the state of Michigan using the p5.js software. The canvas is 400 by 400 pixels wide and I used the 'beginShape()' as well as 'vertex()' to allow me to accurately create the outline. When you run this program you will notice that this only includes the mitt part of Michigan and not the U.P. I chose a royal blue color for my background and a light sky blue for the inside of the outline. The outline is made with a heavy stroke weight.
