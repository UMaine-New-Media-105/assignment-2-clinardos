https://editor.p5js.org/clinardos/full/OTcik2PZn; This is the p5.js link for the first question of Assignment 2. Within this question I copied my code from the previous assignment in which I had created the letter "C" In a pink color with a dark pink background out of squares. For this question, I essentially redid my code or vamped up to create a function in which would create a row within the sketch. I then wrote code that would display multiple of the rows to form a grid. Next, I created another function to allow the "C" to show on top of the row function.
